# SKR MINI E3 v1.2 board Marlin 2.0 firmware for an Ender 3 Pro w/BLtouch (Standard mount) #

## BLTouch Wiring

Bigtreetech have recommended that the BL touch be plugged into the Z-stop and Servo ports and therefore the firmware has been configured as such.

According to the official Antclabs documents the wiring colour used is as shown as above.  Since posting this repo, a number of people have reached out asking about about probes that are using different colour wires.  

 If you have a BLtouch with different colours, the SKR Mini E3 pinouts you need are

## BLtouch Troubleshooting 

Just a few points from my experiences.

1. If the BLtouch lights up when you power on the printer.  You at least have the 5V wire in the correct place.  Within the printer BLtouch menu, select **Deploy Probe**  If the probe tip doesn't deploy, then you need to swap the two outer cables (GND + PA1)
2. I tried a few different pinouts before I actually read the manual.  Despite this, my BLtouch didnt fry itself, as long as you are using the Servo and Z-stop ports you should be ok if you get it wrong.  



## BLTouch Mount

If you use a different mount, just make sure you update the offsets and recompile.  You can find these in the in **configuration.h**

```
/**
 * Z Probe to nozzle (X,Y) offset, relative to (0, 0).
 * X and Y offsets must be integers.
 *
 * In the following example the X and Y offsets are both positive:
 * #define X_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER 10
 * #define Y_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER 10
 *
 *     +-- BACK ---+
 *     |           |
 *   L |    (+) P  | R <-- probe (20,20)
 *   E |           | I
 *   F | (-) N (+) | G <-- nozzle (10,10)
 *   T |           | H
 *     |    (-)    | T
 *     |           |
 *     O-- FRONT --+
 *   (0,0)
 */
#define X_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER -43  // X offset: -left  +right  [of the nozzle]
#define Y_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER -6  // Y offset: -front +behind [the nozzle]
#define Z_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER 0   // Z offset: -below +above  [the nozzle]

```

## License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](/LICENSE) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
